### Project Overview

Keeping a high customer engagement is key for business growth, especially when you are in the online food business. Data analyst works both with business and technical stakeholders to provide insights for potential business growth.
### Tools 
- Microsoft Excel - Data Validation
- Power Query-- Data Cleaning
- Microsoft Power BI - Visualizations

### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading
2. Data Validation
3. Handling missing Values
4. Data Cleaning
### Insights
1. Total Customer number
2. Grouping of customer based on Income group
3. Method of Purchase on the food app
### Recommendations
1. Purchase Method : Most customers prefer making purchases in-store, followed by web purchases. Catalog purchases have the lowest frequency. To enhance customer utilization of catalog and web purchases, ensure that both the catalog and web platforms are regularly updated with all available products.

2. Marital Status : Since most of the customers are married, the stores and app should offer family-friendly items to encourage more purchases and increase profits.

3. Income Group: Out of 2205 customers, the majority belong to the Upper Middle Income bracket, with a small number of Low Income earners. To attract more low income earners, consider introducing Super Low and Low segment products in stores. Additionally, implementing promotions and discounts could help attract a wider range of customers.
